Let's have some fun with my letterboxd data...

## Data

Letterboxd has several different files for data analysis. For instance, the `diary` file looks like this:
```{r diary}
diary <- read.csv(file.path(here::here(), "data", "diary.csv"))
diary %>% 
  as_tibble() %>% 
  sample_n(5)
```

Another useful file might be `watchlist`:
```{r watchlist}
watchlist <- read.csv(file.path(here::here(), "data", "watchlist.csv"))
watchlist %>% 
  as_tibble() %>% 
  sample_n(5)
```

You can view all available files by checking the `data/` folder.
