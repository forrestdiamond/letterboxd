It was... a bit better than that? Still very indulgent and impossible to follow if you didn't have that hollywood history, but the acting was excellent and some scenes were exceptional. 

Could have been significantly shorter, would probably have been better as straight fiction telling the same story rather than historical fiction. 

Also the Bruce Lee scene was pretty shitty and unnecessary.",,2019-11-22

Padmi and Anakin aren't any better- he starts in love, she falls for him despite Anakin remaining a complete ass the entire film. Again, the action scenes are reasonably fun, and again the long-running story arcs make sense on paper, but long stretches of just bad movie.",,2020-01-07
2020-01-09,Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith,2005,https://boxd.it/W3dJV,2,,"Similar goofiness to the first two prequels. Anakin's relationship with Obiwan feels less and less healthy, especially when Anakin gets protective of Obiwan despite spending all of Ep. II shitting on him. It makes that movies relationship feel abusive on the part of Obiwan. On the other hand, some of the early scenes between them actually have jokes that land!
The WWII inspired battle moments are very fun to watch and some of the few moments where the battles are visually clear. The rest of the battles are both opaque and go on forever. The lightsaber fight acrobatics continue to be hilariously goofy and unnecessary, especially when the fighter is 60 years old or shitty CGI.
Still somehow fun to watch, but similar to Ep. II in that there are long stretches of boring nothingness.",,2020-01-06

I hate to nitpick, but there were just too many aspects (editing, writing, overall story choices) that felt slightly off for me to rate it much higher than this. Probably just not my genre, so I won't just list errata.
